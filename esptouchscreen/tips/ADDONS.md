# Add-Ons

Here is a list of additional hardware add-ons that can add functionality to your CYD

## SD Card Sniffer

If you want to use the pins of the SD card for a different purpose, the easiest way to do that is with an "SD card sniffer", which basically plugs into the SD card slot and breaks out the pins. It's particularly useful for SPI devices.

## Pin-out of the Sniffer board

| Sniffer Board Label | ESP32 Pin | SPI Use   |
| ------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| DAT2                | -         | -         |
| CD                  | IO5       | CS        |
| CMD                 | IO23      | DI / MOSI |
| GND                 | GND       | -         |
| VCC                 | 3.3V      | -         |
| CLK                 | IO18      | SCLK      |
| DAT0                | IO19      | DO / MISO |
| DAT1                | -         | -         |

## Nintendo Wii Nunchuck

A Nunchuck controller from a Nintendo Wii is a great input device for CYD projects as they are inexpensive and, since they use i2c for communication, they only require 2 GPIO pins to connect them up.

For these two pins you get:

- An analog stick
- 2 Buttons
- An accelerometer

### Hardware Required

#### Nunchuck controllers

Official Nintendo ones are generally better (maybe try second-hand options), but third-party ones also work fine.

#### Nunchuck Adaptors

There are many different options available for these, even the cheap ones from Aliexpress work perfectly.

### Wiring

The easiest way to wire this up is to use the wire that came with the CYD and the **CN1** JST connector (the one closest to the Micro SD card slot)

Connect the wire to your breakout board as follows:

| CYD CN1 | Adapter     | Note               |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| GND     | - (AKA GND) | Black wire for me  |
| 3.3V    | + (AKA 3V)  | Red wire for me    |
| IO22    | d (AKA SDA) | Blue wire for me   |
| IO27    | c (AKA SCL) | Yellow wire for me |

Note: I have found pull-ups resistors are not required on SDA and SCL

### Example

Check out the [NunchuckTest](/Examples/InputTests/NunchuckTest) example for code how to use it.

## Speakers

A speaker can be attached to the display with a 1.25mm JST connector to the connector labeled "SPEAK" (or soldered)

Check out the [HelloRadio](/Examples/Basics/7-HelloRadio) example for the code on how to use it.

Most small 8 Ohm speakers should work. Maybe worth adding a 1.25mm JST connector to it to make it easy to add remove.
