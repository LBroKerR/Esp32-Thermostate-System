# Original Documentation

This is contents of the rar file on the sellers page, I think it is useful to back it up for archival purposes.

I downloaded this from the [Sunton Store listing](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004502250619.html) on May 21st, 2023

## License Note:

This folder is **NOT** covered by the MIT license as I do not have authority to do that. You will need to contact Sunton to get license information for it.

## Removed folders

I have removed two folders from the original download as some contain executables and are also quite large. These were labeled:

- **1-Demo** - Contains ~30 demos for arduino and 3 for the IDF. It's 900MB though, which is crazy for just code. I may dig through this in the future to see why its so big.
- **7-Character&Picture_Molding_Tool** - Contains several zip and rar files, some of the names in Chinese, so not sure what this does.
- **8-Burn operation** - Seems to be a tool/binary and instructions for flashing the original demo that ships on the device back onto the board.
